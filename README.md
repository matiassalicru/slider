# A very unique and special slider - carousel

_okay so, this is my story with sliders_

Always when I needed one, I need to crawl into the deep packages like ``react-slick`` which I don't really like, almost 90% of the times I cannot make it works, so then the other day I needed to make a Slider with some banner imgs for an ecommerce website, was then when I have to get into all this libraries and packages, like I mention before, but then when I was cleaning dishes I've found a video with just the code, and I copy it and sorprisingly it works really *really* well.

So I make this project for those people who passed the exact same situation with sliders, they could be a headache sometimes.

I Hope this works for you â™¥.

The one uses only CSS, HTML, and a minimun of JS. All this done with React.<br>
And fontAwesome for the arrow icons.

_Oh and the channel where I found this was "Build With Js" in youtube_.
